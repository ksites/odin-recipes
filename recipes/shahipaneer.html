<p>Shahi paneer is one of the most popular dishes ordered at Indian restaurants - aside from butter chicken, of course. If you have never had shahi paneer before, the sauce is very similar to butter chicken sauce, with a little twist. The sauce has cashews blended in it, to add an extra layer or richness and creaminess.</p>
<H3>Ingredients you will need for this Recipe</H3>
<ul>
<li>Past of Onions</li>
<li>Paneer </li>
<li>Ginger & garlic paste</li>
<li>Cashews</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to make the recipe</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Collecting all your ingredients - This will make cooking so much easier. Gather all the spices you will need, and keep them nearby. </li>
  <li>Cutting your ingredients - Chop your onions finely, and cut your paneer into your desired size. I did triangle pieces by sitting the paneer into slices, and then diagonally.</li>
  <li> Saute the onions and ginger/garlic paste in a large skillet in a tablespoon of olive oil, over medium-high heat.</li>
  <li> Once the onions are translucent, add the cashews and let them lightly toast. Add in the spices and cinnamon stick to the skillet and combine with the onions and cashews.</li>
