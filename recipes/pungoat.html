  <p>Punjabi  goat curry is easily made in the  instant pot or  electric pressure cooker with  a spicy  Indian style,  tomato  based  curry sauce.</H3>
<ul>
<li>Fresh goat meat</li>
<li> fresh onions</li>
<li>Ginger & garlic paste</li>
<li>Cashews</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to make the recipe</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Collecting all your ingredients - This will make cooking so much easier. Gather all the spices you will need, and keep them nearby. </li>
  <li>Cutting your ingredients - Chop your onions finely, and cut your paneer into your desired size. I did triangle pieces by sitting the paneer into slices, and then diagonally.</li>
  <li> Saute the onions and ginger/garlic paste in a large skillet in a tablespoon of olive oil, over medium-high heat.</li>
  <li> Once the onions are translucent, add the cashews and let them lightly toast. Add in the spices and cinnamon stick to the skillet and combine with the onions and cashews.</li>
